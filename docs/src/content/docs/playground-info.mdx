## Quick Start

The playground comes pre-loaded with examples of various logical properties:

- **Margin & Padding**: `margin-inline`, `padding-block-start`
- **Borders**: `border-inline-start`, `border-start-start-radius`
- **Positioning**: `inset-inline-start`, `float: inline-start`
- **Sizing**: `inline-size`, `block-size`
- **Text Alignment**: `text-align: start`

## Features

### Real-time Transformation
Type CSS with logical properties and instantly see the transformed output with physical properties and appropriate direction selectors.

### Configuration Options
- **Output Order**: Choose whether LTR or RTL rules come first
- **Custom Selectors**: Modify the LTR and RTL selectors to match your project needs
- **Theme Support**: Switch between light and dark themes

### Browser Compatibility
The playground runs entirely in your browser - no server required! It uses a simplified version of the actual postcss-logical-polyfill plugin.
