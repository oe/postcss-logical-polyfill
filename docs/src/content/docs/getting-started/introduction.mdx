# Introduction

PostCSS Logical Polyfill is a PostCSS plugin that transforms CSS logical properties into physical properties with appropriate direction selectors, enabling backward compatibility for older browsers while preserving the directional behavior for international layouts.

## What are CSS Logical Properties?

CSS Logical Properties and Values provide the author the ability to control layout through logical, rather than physical, direction and dimension mappings. The logical properties define direction‚Äêrelative equivalents to their corresponding physical properties.

For example:
- `margin-inline-start` is the logical equivalent of `margin-left` in LTR languages and `margin-right` in RTL languages
- `padding-block` affects both `padding-top` and `padding-bottom`
- `border-inline-end` becomes `border-right` in LTR and `border-left` in RTL

## The Problem

While modern browsers support CSS logical properties, older browsers don't understand them. This creates a compatibility issue when you want to use modern CSS logical properties but still support a wider range of browsers.

## The Solution

PostCSS Logical Polyfill solves this by:

1. **Detecting logical properties** in your CSS
2. **Converting them to physical properties** that all browsers understand
3. **Adding appropriate direction selectors** (`[dir="ltr"]`, `[dir="rtl"]`) to maintain directional behavior
4. **Optimizing output** by generating single rules for block-direction properties that don't need directional variants

## Key Benefits

### üîÑ Polyfill Direction
Unlike most tools that transform physical properties to logical ones, this plugin works in reverse - transforming logical properties to physical ones for maximum compatibility.

### üéØ Smart Generation
Automatically creates both LTR and RTL versions of your styles, ensuring your international layouts work correctly.

### ‚ö° Optimized Output
Block-direction properties (like `margin-block`, `padding-block`) generate single rules without duplication since they work the same in all directions.

### üîó Extended Support
Includes support for:
- Scroll properties (`scroll-margin-*`, `scroll-padding-*`)
- Overflow properties (`overflow-block`, `overflow-inline`)
- CSS Containment properties (`contain-intrinsic-*-size`)
- Logical values (`float: inline-start`, `clear: inline-end`, `resize: block`)

### üß™ Experimental Features
Supports cutting-edge features like linear gradient logical directions for future-ready CSS.

### üéõÔ∏è Configurable
Customize direction selectors and output order to match your project's needs.

## Browser Support

The generated CSS works in all browsers that support:
- CSS attribute selectors (`[dir="ltr"]`, `[dir="rtl"]`)
- The physical CSS properties being generated

This means virtually all browsers, including:
- Internet Explorer 7+
- All modern browsers
- Mobile browsers

## Use Cases

### International Websites
Perfect for websites that need to support both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) languages.

### Gradual Migration
Ideal for teams wanting to gradually migrate from physical properties to logical properties without breaking existing browser support.

### Modern CSS with Legacy Support
Write modern CSS using logical properties while ensuring it works in older browsers.

### Framework Integration
Easily integrate with any CSS framework or build system that uses PostCSS.
